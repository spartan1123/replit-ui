You are analyzing a Replit web UI project that will control a native Windows C# app (DS4Windows) via IPC.

Please answer the following questions clearly and explicitly. If something does not exist yet, say so.

1) TRANSPORT METHOD
How does this Replit app currently send messages outside the browser?
Check for and report which of these are used (with file paths and code snippets):
- window.chrome.webview.postMessage (WebView2)
- WebSocket (new WebSocket("ws://..."))
- fetch / HTTP calls to localhost
- Other IPC or message bridge

2) MESSAGE ENVELOPE / WRAPPER
Provide ONE real example of a message this app sends outward (exact object or JSON).
If none exist yet, propose the CURRENT standard pattern used in this app (e.g., { type, payload } or { action, data }).

3) SLOT SELECTION
How does the UI determine which controller slot (0–3 or 1–4) it is editing?
- Dropdown?
- Hardcoded?
- Not implemented yet?
If implemented, show the state variable and where it is set.

4) UPDATE FREQUENCY
When a slider or toggle is changed:
- Does the app send updates continuously while dragging?
- Only on mouse release?
- Only when an Apply/Save button is pressed?
Show the relevant event handlers (onChange / onInput / debounce).

5) DATA SHAPE & TYPES
For UI controls, specify:
- Slider values: 0–1 floats, 0–100, or absolute numbers?
- Toggles: true/false or 0/1?
- Enums (e.g., AimMode): strings ("Magnetic") or numeric values?

6) INITIAL STATE SYNC
On app load, does the UI:
- Request current settings from the native app?
- Assume defaults?
If it requests, show the request message and expected response shape.

7) ONE REAL OR PROPOSED SAMPLE PAYLOAD
Provide ONE complete example payload that this UI would send to update enhancements.
If not implemented yet, propose a realistic example based on existing UI state.

Answer concisely, with short explanations and code snippets where applicable.
Do not invent systems that do not exist—state clearly if something is missing.
